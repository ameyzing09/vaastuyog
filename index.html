        <h1 class="title">Vaastuyog Home Loan Solutions</h1>
        <p>While affordable housing may be a major adaption for the PUNE’S HOMEBUYER,
            property buying remains an expensive proposition/ concept.</p>
        <p>
            Having said that, homes are ASSETS that last a LIFETIME and make a good
INVESTMENT option too, and these investments are most often funded through a
Banking source called as HOME LOAN.
        </p>    

        <p>
            But despite that cosy scenario, buying a home is often not a simple task.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before applying for any home loan, it’s important to determine which Bank specifically
suits your requirement best. Among the parameters to consider, INTEREST RATES,
LOAN TENURE, LOAN TO VALUE RATIO, and PROCESSING FEE are just our few
concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
            Further, applying for a HOME LOAN requires a specific procedure to be followed. To
begin with…, the lender (seller/ builder) will require ORIGINAL PROPERTY DOCUMENTS
with all LEGAL and TECHNICAL formalities completed, which you will need to, procure
from the lender (seller/ builder).
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you fill out the application at the bank, an assessment will be carried to ascertain
your ABILITY TO REPAY, the ELIGIBLE AMOUNT as well as your CREDIT SCORE i.e
CIBIL. Following this, the bank carries out an INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION and
VALUATION of the property.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once all the above mentioned criteria are met, the HOME LOAN will be sanctioned and
disbursed.
